Every app starts with Requirements document

first task is to extract use cases for application - use cases are actions that users can perform

For vega app,

- Create vehicles
- Update vehicles
- View vehicles
- Sort vehicles
- Filter vehicles
- Upload photos
- etc

Dependency Graph - start with a use case - which use cases depend on another for example

Filter Vehicles - depends on -> do this 3
	List of vehicles - depends on -> do this 2
		create vehicles do this 1

think about tasks and order to do them

do one task at a time.. don't try to do too many things otherwise you get caught up in details

render simply then once it works you can make it better...

isolate and think about the functionality at hand

Create a Vehicle

- sketch a simple form what are attributes
	Make
		dropdown list
	Model
		this model list populated based on make
	both lists come from the server
	List of Features
		check box list rendered from the server

Create a vehicle
	Angular Form
		API (endpoints to get data to populate form)
			Database
				Domain MOdel (Code first migration)

Focus on a small piece of functionality

transition from asp.net mvc 5 to asp.net core

Challenge #1

		/api/makes
		/api/features

Registered or not?
Owner (name, phone, email)

Vehicle List
	-> View Vehicle
	-> Add Vehicle

Domain Model
	Database
		API

/api/makes

Id
Make
Model

/api/features

Id
Name
